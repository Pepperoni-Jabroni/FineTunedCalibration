## ðŸ“– About
This mod gives extra functionality to Calibrated Sculk Sensors which allow them to output a variable Redstone signal based on Vibrational differences *within* the same Frequency, meaning you can make your Sculk contraptions *even more specifc*! This mod increases the number of unique Frequencies that result from a Calibrated Sculk Sensor + Comparator **from 15 Frequencies to 100+ Frequencies**! Some things you can detect with this mod:
- Which Goat Horn type was blown ("Ponder", "Sing", ...)?
- Which Music Disc was played in a Jukebox ("Block", "13", ...)?
- Which slot of a Chiseled Bookshelf was interacted with (1-6)?
- What type of boots is the player wearing (none, leather, ...)?
- Was the Entity Damage a Player Death?
- What's the tune of the Note Block?
- Was a Redstone Lever just activated?
- And much more!
